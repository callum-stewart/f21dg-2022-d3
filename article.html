<h1 id="online-tutorial">Online Tutorial</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>As part of our F21DG coursework we have produced a front end only web
application that enables the user to explore two differeent approaches
to time series analysis of non-stationary and non-linear signals. The
application allows users to either submit their own signals, or to build
one using a library of predefined signal types, and then perform either
a Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or a Empirical Mode Decomposition
(EMD) on the signal to break it down into it’s constituent component
signals.</p>
<p>This will allow them to explore the differences between these two
methods for decomposing time signals, serving as a demonstration of
their relative strengths and weakness, and providing an intuitive feel
for how they work. The application also has a number of convenience
features for users, such as the ability to bookmark examples, and a
built in interface tutorial.</p>
<p>In this online tutorial we will first explore some of the theory
behind STFT and and EMD. Then we will run through some example analyses
using both generated signals and pregenerated signals as CSVs, which can
be found <!-- TODO: HERE --> Pregenerated signals can be entered
manually as specified, or you can click on the link to have the sample
preconfigured for you <a

<h3 id="time-series-analysis">Time Series Analysis</h3>
<p>A <em>time series</em> is a sequence of data points that are indexed
or graphed in time order. Frequently graphed in a run chart (a graph
which features time as its <code>y</code> axis), time series occur
naturally in a wide array of subjects, such as statistics, finance,
weather forecasting, and signal processing.</p>
<p>There are a handful of common types of time series that occur widely,
for example: 1. Simple sinusoids 1. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, or
polynomial trends 1. White, coloured, or shot noise 1. Chirps 1.
Products and sums of the above signals, forming complex signals that
might be found in the real world</p>
<p><em>Time series analysis</em> is a set of techniques that can be used
in order to reason about time series’, enabling an analyst to extract
useful insights from the data.</p>
<p>Many time series exhibit an oscillatory behaviour, such as the
temperature of a city on any given day of the year, the share price of a
given stock, or the audio data recorded by a microphone. An analyst can
exploit the fact that complex signals can be approximated with sums of
simpler trigonometric functions and use Fourier analysis to decompose a
signal into its oscillatory components.</p>
<p>When we begin to run examples by building signals through the UI, you
will see that the top graph demonstrates this fact, showing the
individual components and then the result of their superposition. Below
is a screenshot of our application superposing a sinusoid and a chirp,
you can see this for yourself <a

Ignore the spectrogram for now, we will explain that later, and please
feel free to explore the graph using the pan and zoom controls.</p>
<p><img src="img/composition_of_signals.png"
alt="Complex signal derived from simple signals" />
<!-- TODO: replace with scrot from our app --></p>
<p>For the rest of this theory section we will be using signals
generated and analysed in a Jupyter Notebook, due to limitaions in the
application (such as not having the capability of performing FFT). Once
we have gone over the theory we will begin to use the application to
perform some more simple analysis.</p>
<h3 id="discrete-fourier-transform">Discrete Fourier Transform</h3>
<p>A Fourier transform is one way of decomposing a complex signal into
its oscillatory components, revealing the frequencies of the constituent
component signals. Determining what component frequencies are present in
a signal can give an insight into the nature of a signal, or allow it to
be manipulated precisely. For example, it may allow an audio engineer to
silence or boost particular frequencies as they see fit, or a financial
analyst to determine what kind of long term trends exist in financial
data.</p>
<p>Lets look at an example of a Fourier transform of this complex
signal.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/composite_signal.png"
alt="Complex signal derived from simple signals" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Complex signal derived from simple
signals</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We will use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to compute the
transform.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/fft.png" alt="Fourier transform of complex signal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fourier transform of complex
signal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that despite having a strong indication that the constant 3Hz
and 18Hz signals are constituent components, much information has been
lost. As a Fourier transform maps a function from the time domain to the
frequency domain, all temporal information is lost, as the FFT assumes
periodicity. This is obviously not ideal, as our complex signal is
non-linear. The Fourier transform is thus not well suited to non-linear
signals when applied on the entire signal at once.</p>
<h3 id="short-time-fourier-transform">Short Time Fourier Transform</h3>
<p>Instead, in order to study non-stationary signals, we require a
technique that can study a signal in both the time and frequency domain
simultaneously. The simplest of these techniques is the Short Time
Fourier Transform (STFT).</p>
<p>The procedure for STFT is to divide a long time signal equally into
shorter length segments, and then compute a DFT on each of these
segments. In order to smooth out any unusual artefacts at the boundary
of segments, window functions such as a Hann window may be used, which
attenuates signals located near boundaries using a cosine window. With
the Fourier spectra of each shorter segment, we can plot the changing
spectra against time using a type of plot known as a spectrogram. Here
is an example of STFT applied to our original signal.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/stft_output_spectra.png"
alt="Resulting spectra from STFT applied to complex signal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Resulting spectra from STFT applied to
complex signal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here we can see the strength of each constituent signal by colour
intensity. Unlike previously with the FFT, we now have temporal
information, and can see when signals of a given frequency begin and end
in the complex signal.</p>
<h4 id="stft-limitations">STFT Limitations</h4>
<p>However there is a significant limitation to building on top of
Fourier transforms due to an uncertainty limit called the Gabor limit.
By making the time resolution smaller (i.e., by dividing the main signal
into smaller windows) we become more certain of when frequencies change,
but we lose frequency resolution (the ability to see frequency
components close together). By making the time resolutions larger, we
lose time resolution (the ability to know precisely when a frequency
changes), but we get better frequency resolution.</p>
<p>We will explore the Gabor limit in more depth through the use of the
application later.</p>
<h3
id="hilbert-huang-transform-and-empirical-mode-decomposition">Hilbert-Huang
Transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition</h3>
<p>The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is a powerful time-frequency
analysis technique. It allows an analyst to decompose a complex signal
into a number of orthogonal Intrinsic Mode Frequencies (IMFs) with a
trend using EMD and applies Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA) to the IMFs
to obtain information regarding instantaneous frequency.</p>
<p>HHT first utilises empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in order to
break a complex waveform into IMFs representing simple oscillatory modes
through a process called sifting. The amplitude and frequency of an IMF
may vary with time, and must satisfy both of these rules: 1. The total
number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must differ by at
most 1 2. The mean envelope value (defined by a spline described by the
local maxima and the local minima) must be nearly zero</p>
<p>The sifting procedure to extract these IMFs can be described by the
following steps: 1. Initialise <code>r_0 = X(t)</code> and
<code>i = 1</code> 1. Start outer loop 1. Extract the <code>i</code>th
IMF <code>c_i</code> 1. Initialise <code>h_{k(k-1)} = r_{i-1}</code>,
<code>k = 1</code> 1. Start inner loop 1. Identify all of the local
maxima and minima (the extrema) 1. Interpolate the minima with a cubic
spline in order to define the lower envelope 1. Interpolate the maxima
with a cubic spline in order to define the upper envelope 1. Calculate
the mean <code>m_{i(k-1)}</code> of the upper and lower envelopes of
<code>h_{i(k-1)}</code>. The envelope defined by the two cubic splines
should contain all data. 1. Set
<code>h_{ik} = h_{i(k-1)} - m_{i(k-1)}</code> 1. Is <code>h_{ik}</code>
an IMF? - If true, set <code>c_i = h_{ik}</code> and break - Else
increment <code>k</code> and continue inner loop 1. Set the remainder
<code>r_{i+1} = r_i - c_i</code> 1. Does <code>r_{i + 1}</code> contain
at least two extrema? - If true increment <code>i</code> and continue
outer loop - Else end routine, with <code>r_{i + 1}</code> as the signal
residue and <code>c_1</code> through <code>c_i</code> as the IMFs</p>
<p>Below is a flowchart describing this algorithm<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/emd_flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart of EMD algorithm" />

alt="Animation of the sifting procedure used in EMD" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Animation of the sifting procedure used
in EMD</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The number of sifting steps required to produce an IMF is determined
by the stopping criterion. There are a number of stopping criterion that
can be used for EMD, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
The one proposed by Huang et al. (1998) however is the ‘Standard
Deviation’ method. For each point in time, the difference between the
current component and the previous component is calculated, squared,
divided by the square of the previous component evaluated at that point
in time, and summed.</p>
<pre class="math"><code>SD_{k}=\sum _{{t=0}}^{{T}}{\frac  {|h_{{k-1}}(t)-h_{k}(t)|^{2}}{h_{{k-1}}^{2}(t)}}</code></pre>
<p>Once this value falls below a predetermined threshold, the sifting
process can be stopped.</p>
<p>There are other stopping criterion that may be used however, such as
S Number Criterion or Energy Difference Tracking.</p>
<p>Below we can see an example of EMD being performed on a complex
signal, breaking it down into its constituent modes in descending
frequency order<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/emd_example.png"
alt="An example of EMD being performed on a signal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An example of EMD being performed on a
signal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At this point, if desired, the instantaneous frequency spectrum can
be obtained by applying the Hilbert transform on the constituent IMFs.
The final result would be called a Hilbert spectrum, where the amplitude
and instantaneous frequency can be plotted as functions of time on a
three dimensional plot.</p>
<p>We will show an example later of HSA analysis, however our
application is not capable of performing it on its own. This is due to
the immense size of the HHT transform matrix that it produces, and the
lack of support for efficient data structures used for holding the
results of such a calculation. Typically you would use a COOrdinate
matrix, where you only store the coordinates and values of non-zero
elements. This is efficient for the output of the Hilbert Huang
transform as it is mostly empty space. However there is no support for
this kind of data structure when using Pyodide as we have for running
Python code in the browser, and thus we will run out of heap space
before the calculation has concluded. In the future, having a sparse
array implementation would be able to improve this aspect of the
application greatly.</p>
<h4 id="emd-limitations">EMD limitations</h4>
<p>Unlike STFT, EMD is a self-adaptive signal processing method. The
IMFs are determined by the signal itself, and are representative of the
natural oscillatory mode embedded in the signal. Thus EMD works on the
characteristic time local time scale, rather than with predetermined
windows.</p>
<p>Of course, EMD has weaknesses as well, for example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>EMD suffers from end effects. This will be explored later on.</li>
<li>The IMFs may not be orthogonal</li>
<li>Mode mixing sometimes occurs between IMFs, where a single IMF
includes oscillatory modes that are drastically different or a component
of a different IMF all together.</li>
<li>It could potentially have a higher computational complexity. As the
number of cycles of the sifting algorithm is determined by the signal
itself, it is impossible to know ahead of time how long the IMFs will
take to calculate.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, each time-frequency analysis technique has draw backs
and advantages, and neither one is conclusively the correct one to use
in any given situation. This being said, for analysing non-stationary
signals EMD has some obvious advantages compared to STFT and can be
considered superior in most cases <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"

<h1 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h1>
<p>In this section we will run you through some examples that will allow
you to experiment with the application and get a more intuitive feel for
how these signals analysis methods work. It will <em>not</em> provided a
detailed overview of the UI, as we have implementated tooltips for this
purpose.</p>
<h2 id="running-an-stft-analysis">Running an STFT analysis</h2>
<p>We will first use the signals generator to generate a couple of
examples.</p>
<h3 id="stft-of-a-single-sinuoid">STFT of a Single Sinuoid</h3>
<p>First, let’s look at the STFT output for a single sinusoid. To do so,
click ‘STFT’ and ‘Create Signal’, and add a sinusoid of 0 phase, 2000 Hz
frequency, and an amplitude of 100. Click <a
href="../index.html?analysisMethod=STFT&amp;dataMethod=config&amp;1-id=1&amp;1-type=sinusoid&amp;1-phase=0&amp;1-frequency=2000&amp;1-amplitude=100&amp;combinationMethod=sum#">here</a>
to have a look with a 2kHz sinusoid.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/simple_sinusoid_stft.png" alt="Simple Sinusoid STFT" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Simple Sinusoid STFT</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see a single, flat line at the 2kHz mark. The spectrogram is a
3D plot, where the colour of every point on the graph represents the
signal strength at that particular time and frequency. Thus, the single
flat line indicates that at 2kHz, for the full 10 seconds, there is a
2kHz frequency present.</p>
<h3 id="stft-of-two-sinuoids">STFT of Two Sinuoids</h3>
<p>Now, we can add another sinusoid, for example a 4kHz sinusoid, <a
href="../index.html?analysisMethod=STFT&amp;dataMethod=config&amp;1-id=1&amp;1-type=sinusoid&amp;1-phase=0&amp;1-frequency=2000&amp;1-amplitude=100&amp;combinationMethod=sum&amp;2-id=2&amp;2-type=sinusoid&amp;2-phase=0&amp;2-frequency=4000&amp;2-amplitude=100#">and
see what happens</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/two_simple_sins_stft.png"
alt="Two Simple Sinusoid STFT" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Two Simple Sinusoid STFT</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see that a second flat line appears at the 4kHz mark. From
this graph, we can tell that at any point in time there are two
frequencies present, a 2kHz frequency and a 4kHz frequency. We can also
tell by the colour intensity that they are of equal strength.</p>
<p>You can click <a href="img/">here</a> to discover what it looks like
when two waves of different amplitudes are combined.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/two_sins_diffamps_stft.png"
alt="Two Simple Sinusoid Different Amplitude" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Two Simple Sinusoid Different
Amplitude</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can tell from the output of this graph that the frequency at 4kHz
is less intense than the frequency at 2kHz. This is due to the fact that
the 4kHz sinusoid has half of the amplitude of the 2kHz sinusoid.</p>
<h3 id="stft-of-a-chirp">STFT of a Chirp</h3>
<p>Let’s now analyse the STFT output of a chirp, with an inital
frequency of 0, a chirp rate of 100, and an amplitude of 100. Or you can
<a
href="../index.html?analysisMethod=STFT&amp;dataMethod=config&amp;1-id=1&amp;1-type=chirp&amp;1-frequency=0&amp;1-rate=100&amp;1-amplitude=100&amp;combinationMethod=sum#">click
here</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/chirp_stft.png" alt="Image of the STFT analysis" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image of the STFT analysis</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A chirp is a signal that gradually increases in frequency, which is
what is being reflected in this spectrogram. We can see a linear trend
in the spectrograph, indicating an frequency that is increasing at a
linear rate proportional to the slope of the line.</p>
<p>You can see the affect of increasing the chirp rate <a
href="../index.html?analysisMethod=STFT&amp;dataMethod=config&amp;1-id=1&amp;1-type=chirp&amp;1-frequency=0&amp;1-rate=200&amp;1-amplitude=100&amp;combinationMethod=sum#">here</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/steeper_chirp_stft.png" alt="STFT analysis of chirp 2" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">STFT analysis of chirp 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lets now multiply a chirp by a linear ramp. A linear ramp is simply a
non oscillatory series that increases linearly with time. This time we
will take a product, rather than a sum.</p>
<p>We can see the result of this kind of analysis <a
href="../index.html?analysisMethod=STFT&amp;dataMethod=config&amp;1-id=1&amp;1-type=chirp&amp;1-frequency=0&amp;1-rate=200&amp;1-amplitude=100&amp;combinationMethod=product&amp;2-id=2&amp;2-type=trend&amp;2-trendType=linear&amp;2-alpha=10&amp;2-beta=0&amp;2-gamma=0#">here</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/chirp_with_ramp_stft.png"
alt="STFT analysis of chirp with ramp" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">STFT analysis of chirp with
ramp</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can now see that the signal is linearly increasing on two axes at
once. As the frequency is increasing linearly, we can see that the
output has an upwards slope. However, the amplitude of the signal is
also linearly increasing thanks to it being multiplied by a linear
trend, hence why the colour of the signal is gradually increasing
too.</p>
<h3 id="stft-of-an-uploaded-signal">STFT of an Uploaded Signal</h3>
<p>You can download the <code>stft_sample.csv</code> file <a
href="">here</a> <!-- TODO --> This CSV was generated by following <a
href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.stft.html">the
steps in SciPy’s STFT documentation</a> and then dumping the time series
as a CSV. We can then upload the file by selecting ‘STFT’ and ‘Upload
Signal’ and following the prompts. After performing the analysis you
should be presented with the following graph.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/stft_from_sample.png" alt="stft from sample" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">stft from sample</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see that there appears to be an oscillation in the
spectrogram, reflecting the fact that the frequency of the input signal
is changing in a sinusoidal pattern.</p>
<h3 id="drawbacks-of-stft-analysis">Drawbacks of STFT analysis</h3>
<p>A limitation of any signals analysis technique built on top of
Fourier Transforms called the Gabor uncertainty limit. The Gabor limit
refers to the fact that the exact frequency and time of a signal cannot
be known simultaneously, I.E., a signal can never be a plotted as a
point on a frequency time graph. You may have heard of a similar
phenomena in quantum mechanics called the Eisenberg uncertainty
principal, where the momentum and position of a partical cannot be known
at the same time. These two phenomena are in fact the same phenomena,
owing to the wave like qualities of particals. The uncertainty is a
property of the signal itself, not a limitation of the mathematics. You
can read more <a
href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/1/15/what-is-the-gabor-uncertainty-principle.html">here</a>
if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>We can see the Gabor limit in action using the provided CSV
<!-- name -->. When selecting the ‘Upload’ and ‘STFT’ options you will
be presented with a dialog that allows you to choose the length of each
segment. This segment length directly controls the time resolution of
the STFT analysis, by choosing a higher length per segment, you are
increasing the number of time samples in each segment, thus decreasing
the time resolution and increasing the frequency resolution.</p>
<p>Upload the <code>steps.csv</code> file and leave length per segment
at its default value of 256 for now. It will produce the following
spectrogram.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/stft_steps_256.png" alt="256" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">256</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hopefully you can see what the original signal was: a series of
sinusoids of various frequencies that were concatenated together,
causing this step like pattern in the spectrogram.</p>
<p>Now redo the analysis and choose the lowest length per segment
available, 128. Remember, this will decrease the size of the segment
that the DFT is performed on, increasing the time resolution. It should
look like this.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/stft_steps_128.png" alt="128" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">128</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see that the bars that represent the sinusoids are thicker in
the <code>y</code> direction. This reflects the fact that the increased
time resolution has resulted in us being less certain of what the
precise frequency is. On the other hand, there is less overlap between
the transitions between steps, reflecting the fact that while we are
less certain of what their precise frequency is, we are more certain
about exactly when these signals start and stop.</p>
<p>Lets now redo the analysis using a length segment of 2048.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/stft_steps_2048.png" alt="2048" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">2048</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see now that each signal has a very narrow bar in the
<code>y</code> direction, reflecting the fact that we are more certain
of precisely what frequency these signals are. Conversly, we can see a
significant overlap in the signal transitions (there is no overlap in
the original signal), reflecting the fact that while we are more certain
of precisely what frequency these signals are, we are less certain of
exactly when they begin and end.</p>
