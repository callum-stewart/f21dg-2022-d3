<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In this project we are seeking to create an educational tool that can
be used to interactively explore the differences between two approaches
to time series analysis of non-stationary signals. The front end only
application will allow users to either submit their own signals, or to
build one using a library of predefined signal types, and then perform
either a Short Time Fourier Transform or a Empirical Mode Decomposition
on the signal to break it down into it’s constituent component
signals.</p>
<p>This will allow them to explore the differences between these two
methods for decomposing time signals, serving as a demonstration of
their relative strengths and weakness, and providing an intuitive feel
for how they work. The application will also have a number of
convenience features for users, such as the ability to bookmark
examples, and a pre-generated set of examples that can be used to
demonstrate how the application and how the time series analysis
techniques work.</p>

<h3 id="time-series-analysis">Time Series Analysis</h3>
<p>A <em>time series</em> is a sequence of data points that are indexed
or graphed in time order. Frequently graphed in a run chart (a graph
which features time as its <span class="math inline">$`y`$</span> axis),
time series occur naturally in a wide array of subjects, such as
statistics, finance, weather forecasting, and signal processing.</p>
<p>There are a handful of common types of time series that occur widely,
for example: 1. Simple sinusoids 1. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, or
polynomial trends 1. White, coloured, or shot noise 1. Chirps 1.
Products and sums of the above signals, forming complex signals that
might be found in the real world</p>
<p><em>Time series analysis</em> is a set of techniques that can be used
in order to reason about time series’, enabling an analyst to extract
useful insights from the data.</p>
<p>Many time series exhibit an oscillatory behaviour, such as the
temperature of a city on any given day of the year, the share price of a
given stock, or the audio data recorded by a microphone. An analyst can
exploit the fact that complex signals can be approximated with sums of
simpler trigonometric functions and use Fourier analysis to decompose a
signal into its oscillatory components.</p>

<p>A Fourier transform is one way of decomposing a complex signal into
its oscillatory components, revealing the frequencies of the constituent
component signals. Determining what component frequencies are present in
a signal can give an insight into the nature of a signal, or allow it to
be manipulated precisely. For example, it may allow an audio engineer to
silence or boost particular frequencies as they see fit, or a financial
analyst to determine what kind of long term trends exist in financial
data. Lets look at an example of a Fourier transform of the previous
signal. We will use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to
compute the transform.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fourier transform of complex
signal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that despite having a strong indication that the constant 3Hz
and 18Hz signals are constituent components, much information has been
lost. As a Fourier transform maps a function from the time domain to the
frequency domain, all temporal information is lost, as the FFT assumes
periodicity. This is obviously not ideal, as our complex signal is
non-linear. The Fourier transform is thus not well suited to non-linear
signals when applied on the entire signal at once.</p>
<h3 id="short-time-fourier-transform">Short Time Fourier Transform</h3>
<p>Instead, in order to study non-stationary signals, we require a
technique that can study a signal in both the time and frequency domain
simultaneously. The simplest of these techniques is the Short Time
Fourier Transform (STFT).</p>
<p>The procedure for STFT is to divide a long time signal equally into
shorter length segments, and then compute a DFT on each of these
segments. In order to smooth out any unusual artefacts at the boundary
of segments, window functions such as a Hann window may be used, which
attenuates signals located near boundaries using a cosine window. With
the Fourier spectra of each shorter segment, we can plot the changing
spectra against time using a type of plot known as a spectrogram. Here
is an example of STFT applied to our original signal.</p>
<figure>

alt="Resulting spectra from STFT applied to complex signal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Resulting spectra from STFT applied to
complex signal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here we can see the strength of each constituent signal by colour
intensity. Unlike previously with the FFT, we now have temporal
information, and can see when signals of a given frequency begin and end
in the complex signal.</p>
<p>However there is a significant limitation to building on top of
Fourier transforms due to an uncertainty limit called the Gabor limit.
By making the time resolution smaller (i.e., by dividing the main signal
into smaller windows) we become more certain of when frequencies change,
but we lose frequency resolution (the ability to see frequency
components close together). By making the time resolutions larger, we
lose time resolution (the ability to know precisely when a frequency
changes), but we get better frequency resolution.</p>

id="hilbert-huang-transform-and-empirical-mode-decomposition">Hilbert-Huang
Transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition</h3>
<p>The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is a powerful time-frequency
analysis technique. It allows an analyst to decompose a complex signal
into a number of orthogonal Intrinsic Mode Frequencies (IMFs) with a
trend using EMD and applies Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA) to the IMFs
to obtain information regarding instantaneous frequency.</p>
<p>HHT first utilises empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in order to
break a complex waveform into IMFs representing simple oscillatory modes
through a process called sifting. The amplitude and frequency of an IMF
may vary with time, and must satisfy both of these rules: 1. The total
number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must differ by at
most 1 2. The mean envelope value (defined by a spline described by the
local maxima and the local minima) must be nearly zero</p>
<p>The sifting procedure to extract these IMFs can be described by the
following steps: 1. Initialise <span class="math inline">$`r_0 =
X(t)`$</span> and <span class="math inline">$`i = 1`$</span> 1. Start
outer loop 1. Extract the <span class="math inline">$`i`$</span>th IMF
<span class="math inline">$`c_i`$</span> 1. Initialise <span
class="math inline">$`h_{k(k-1)} = r_{i-1}`$</span>, <span
class="math inline">$`k = 1`$</span> 1. Start inner loop 1. Identify all
of the local maxima and minima (the extrema) 1. Interpolate the minima
with a cubic spline in order to define the lower envelope 1. Interpolate
the maxima with a cubic spline in order to define the upper envelope 1.
Calculate the mean <span class="math inline">$`m_{i(k-1)}`$</span> of
the upper and lower envelopes of <span
class="math inline">$`h_{i(k-1)}`$</span>. The envelope defined by the
two cubic splines should contain all data. 1. Set <span
class="math inline">$`h_{ik} = h_{i(k-1)} - m_{i(k-1)}`$</span> 1. Is
<span class="math inline">$`h_{ik}`$</span> an IMF? - If true, set <span
class="math inline">$`c_i = h_{ik}`$</span> and break - Else increment
<span class="math inline">$`k`$</span> and continue inner loop 1. Set
the remainder <span class="math inline">$`r_{i+1} = r_i - c_i`$</span>
1. Does <span class="math inline">$`r_{i + 1}`$</span> contain at least
two extrema? - If true increment <span class="math inline">$`i`$</span>
and continue outer loop - Else end routine, with <span
class="math inline">$`r_{i + 1}`$</span> as the signal residue and <span
class="math inline">$`c_1`$</span> through <span
class="math inline">$`c_i`$</span> as the IMFs</p>
<p>Below is a flowchart describing this algorithm<a href="#fn1"

</figure>
<p>The number of sifting steps required to produce an IMF is determined
by the stopping criterion. There are a number of stopping criterion that
can be used for EMD, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
The one proposed by Huang et al. (1998) however is the ‘Standard
Deviation’ method. For each point in time, the difference between the
current component and the previous component is calculated, squared,
divided by the square of the previous component evaluated at that point
in time, and summed.</p>
<pre class="math"><code>SD_{k}=\sum _{{t=0}}^{{T}}{\frac  {|h_{{k-1}}(t)-h_{k}(t)|^{2}}{h_{{k-1}}^{2}(t)}}</code></pre>
<p>Once this value falls below a predetermined threshold, the sifting
process can be stopped.</p>
<p>There are other stopping criterion that may be used however, such as
S Number Criterion or Energy Difference Tracking.</p>
<p>Below we can see an example of EMD being performed on a complex
signal, breaking it down into its constituent modes in descending
frequency order<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/emd_example.png"
alt="An example of EMD being performed on a signal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An example of EMD being performed on a

</figure>
<p>At this point, if desired, the instantaneous frequency spectrum can
be obtained by applying the Hilbert transform on the constituent IMFs.
The final result would be called a Hilbert spectrum, where the amplitude
and instantaneous frequency can be plotted as functions of time on a
three dimensional plot.</p>
<p>Unlike STFT, EMD is a self-adaptive signal processing method. The
IMFs are determined by the signal itself, and are representative of the
natural oscillatory mode embedded in the signal. Thus EMD works on the
characteristic time local time scale, rather than with predetermined
windows.</p>
<p>Of course, EMD has weaknesses as well, for example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>EMD suffers from end effects</li>
<li>The IMFs may not be orthogonal</li>
<li>Mode mixing sometimes occurs between IMFs, where a single IMF
includes oscillatory modes that are drastically different or a component
of a different IMF all together.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, each time-frequency analysis technique has draw backs
and advantages, and neither one is conclusively the correct one to use
in any given situation. This being said, for analysing non-stationary
signals EMD has some obvious advantages compared to STFT and can be
considered superior in most cases <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
